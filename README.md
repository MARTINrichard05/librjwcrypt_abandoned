This is my first project called librpycrypt witch is a librairy wich is designed to work
with a program.

This is a librairy to encrypt or decrypt some data (text) in a simple and (i think) secure way,
for this reason i want to have some feedback about the security level of that thing.

This is the first verion i publish so it can have some glitches.

For the moment it does not support spaces so you_have_to_write_like_that or like-that

I'm gona fix this soon

feel free to ask questions about how it works or to give a feedback





exept for the function crypt mode is input(user -> programm) or output(programm -> user)

for the function crypt modes are:  en for encrypt  or  de for decrypt



main .py is more an example of how it works , i'm gona create a more finished version of it but it is still usable
